This is the website Chris Keene. I'm based in Brighton, UK. nostuff.org has been my home on the web since around 2002.


My background is in technology in academic libraries, research and higher education. 

This website goes somewhat through a boom and bust cycle. That latter currently being the case (and arguable always has been, hence the name). 

You will find a collection of quite old [articles, ramblings and unchecked grammar in something that looks suspiciously like a blog](https://www.nostuff.org/words/).

You can also find me at:
